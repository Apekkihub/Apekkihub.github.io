            A Japanese 9th grade is drugged midst their field trip and are placed in a remote island playing a simple game: last one alive will get to go home. 
            There will be no mercy and the game will be played seriously from the start, the weapons vary from pot lids to crossbows and they are distributed at random. 
            The players have three days to complete the game or no one will leave the island alive.
